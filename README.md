## Feed Bluebs!!

Small take on squirrel-eats-squirrel.. 
Blueberry dragon edition.

### How to install and get started!
* clone this repo
* create a venv if you wanna
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python blueberry_dragon.py`

#### Caveats..
I am running with:
* Python 3.6.8
* MacOS Mojave 10.14.4 

As of now, python3.7 + mojave + pygame is not a good combo-wombo.
Python3.6 is a good workaround. 

### How to play
You start so so tiny. 
Avoid the big bluebs.
Eat the small bluebs to grow.
Reach **_Omega Dragon_** status.
